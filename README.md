The Get Nextline project is a C programming project that involves reading a file or multiple files and outputting the contents of each line. <br>
The project is designed to help students develop their understanding of file input/output operations and memory allocation in C. <br>

The project involves creating a function that reads a file line by line and returns each line as a string.  <br>
The function should be able to handle different types of line terminators (such as '\n' and '\r\n') and be able to read from multiple files at once. <br>
The project also involves managing memory allocation to ensure that the program doesn't run out of memory or cause memory leaks. <br>

The Get Nextline project is typically hosted on GitHub as a repository, where students can access the source code and contribute to the project. <br>
The repository may contain multiple branches, each with different versions of the project, and may also include documentation, tests, and other related files. <br>

Overall, the Get Nextline project is a great way for students to gain hands-on experience with file input/output operations and memory allocation in C.
